              <h2>DFA Documentary Episode 6</h2>
              <div class="float"><img src="img12.jpg" alt="DFA"></div>
              <p>
                    Somehow this continues to be one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time. This month we started to see how the team reacted to some of the challenges regarding art that came up last episode. Bagel shared with us his frustration at how he feels as though he is coloring other people's paintings. While the work that Peter Chen did was great, I can understand Bagel's frustration at being told to just color Peter's art. The idea is that this game would reflect Bagel's art style and currently he doesn't have a lot of art in the game. The team also had to figure out how to divide some of the art work in order to finish the game on time. Currently they only have two artists, and Bagel needs to do most of the painting. Hopefully we'll see how this plays out in next month episode. Just a heads up the episode 8 is going to be released late due to company obilgations.

                Yes, reviewers recieve swag from publishers with big releases. Some of it is stupid stuff like the flag that came with Assassin's Creed 3 or the Straight jacket that came with Batman: Arkham City. These goodies should have no influence on the score that reviewers give the game, and for the most part they don't. I really don't care what comes with the review copy, I'm going to keep my journalist integrity. Publishers send this crap because they know some people might tweet images of what came in the mail. That mention is worth a lot to publishers. Some places like Kotaku might make video content based on some of this stuff. Hopefully this witch hunt will end soon, and everyone will calm down.
