Here is my top ten list of typography rules to follow for the web. 
1. When picking fonts for headers and paragraphs pick one serif and one sans-serif. 
2. There should be an appropriate amount of white space between all elements.
3. Don’t use more than three fonts 
4. Make sure the line height allows for maximum readability. 
5. Try not to use justified alignment ever. 
6. Ensure that the leading and kerning are properly set. 
7. Use the Fibonacci sequence or something similar to give your page a “natural elegance.” 
8. Pick a simple font for the paragraph font; place a high value on readability. 
9. The paragraph font size should be between 10 and 12 pt. 
10. Make sure the font color and the background color have enough contrast so that people don’t struggle to read the page
