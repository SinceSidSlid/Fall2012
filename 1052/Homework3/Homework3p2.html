				Released for the PlayStation 2 in 2009, Persona 4 featured another fanastic world with great characters and gameplay.
				While not as gloomy as Persona 3, the game still has it's moments that make you ponder our own existence and how we, as human beings, interact with one another. The game received a Metacritic score of 90, which is very high considering how poorly JRPGs have been doing lately.

				Striking while the iron was hot, Atlus helped develop an anime series based on the game. The twenty six episode series started airing in October of 2011 and wrapped up in late March of 2012. While reviews have been mixed, most people agree the series was a faithful recreation. Later this year the final twenty seventh episode will be released along side the final DVD and Blu-Ray of the series.

				The team behind games such as BlazeBlu and Guilty Gear X worked with Atlus to create a Persona based fighting game. While titled Persona 4 Arena, the game also uses some the characters from Persona 3. While not considered part of the main series, the game contains a story that is canon. The game has seen limited tournament exposure and is not likely to find itself at EVO next year.

				Persona 4: Golden is a release and update of Persona 4 for the PS Vita. Atlus promises to fill in the gap between Christmas and the end of the school year in March that is glossed over in the original game. They have also added the character and social link, Marie. Yu meets Marie as he arrives in Inaba and discovers that she doesn't know who she is. The game will be released in November 2012.
